## **10) Hybrid Pattern Examples**
| Problem | Patterns Combined | Why Both Are Needed |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| Word Ladder | BFS + Combination | BFS ensures shortest transformation; generating all next words requires combinational letter changes. |
| Open the Lock | BFS + Permutation | BFS finds minimal moves; neighbors are generated by permuting wheel positions. |
| Sliding Puzzle | BFS + Permutation | BFS for shortest path; board states are permutations of tiles via swaps. |
| Minimum Genetic Mutation | BFS + Combination | BFS for minimum mutations; combinations from altering gene positions. |
| Knight’s Shortest Path | BFS + Permutation | BFS finds shortest moves; permutations of 8 possible moves per step. |
| Sudoku Solver | DFS/BFS + Combination | Search tree (BFS/DFS) to fill cells; combinations for candidate numbers. |
| Word Search II | DFS + Combination | DFS explores board; combinations from building words using trie branches. |
| Generate Parentheses with Constraints | BFS + Combination | BFS level-by-level for valid parentheses; generate combinations of '(' and ')'. |
| Shortest Path to Get All Keys | BFS + Bitmask (Combination encoding) | BFS for shortest steps; bitmask encodes combinations of collected keys. |
| Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes | BFS + Permutation/Combination | BFS finds minimal path; state encodes permutation of visited nodes. |
